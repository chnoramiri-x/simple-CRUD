## The Simple-CRUD assignment
This little CRUD task developed with a ReactJs project. It contains a sidebar with 2 menus 'Users' and 'Products'.

## The Products menu
The list of products will be retrieved in this page, and are shown in a Bootstrap table.

## The Users menu
In addition to the list of users, the user can be created, edited, and deleted.

## Challenges
Several important topics are used in the project which is essential for React developers to know.
`local storage`, `pagination`, `HTTP methods`, `axios`, and `Bootstrap`.

In order to get the data the `get` method of `axios` is called, and also for creating a new user the `post` method is used,
also, the `put` and `delete` methods are utilized for editing and removing actions.
